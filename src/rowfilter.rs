//! Loop filters row by row while a picture decodes (frame threading).
//!
//! With frame threading a picture is referenced while it is still being
//! decoded, so its rows must become final (deblocked and SAO-filtered) as
//! decoding goes, not only at the end. [`RowFilter`] runs both filters one
//! CTB row at a time as rows finish decoding, and publishes the rows that
//! are final in the picture's progress:
//!
//! - Deblocking CTB row `r` (luma rows `[y0, y1)`) waits until row `r + 1`
//!   is decoded: intra prediction of row `r + 1` reads row `r`'s bottom
//!   samples, and the horizontal edge at the top of row `r` changes the
//!   bottom of row `r - 1`, both before loop filtering. Then its vertical
//!   edges, then its horizontal edges `y0 <= y < y1`.
//!   A horizontal edge at row `y` reads rows `y - 4 ..= y + 3` and writes
//!   `y - 3 ..= y + 2` (chroma `yc - 2 ..= yc + 1`), so it sees exactly what
//!   the whole-picture order (all vertical edges, then all horizontal ones)
//!   would show it.
//! - SAO of row `r` reads deblocked samples one row beyond it, which are
//!   final once row `r + 1` is deblocked, so it runs then (or at the end,
//!   for the last row). The SAO input is a snapshot of the deblocked rows,
//!   copied just before SAO changes them.
//! - After SAO of row `r`, rows `< y1` never change again: the next
//!   deblocking step writes rows from `y1(r + 1) - 3` on. They are
//!   published as final.
//!
//! Which CTB rows are decoded is tracked by [`DecodedRows`], in every mode:
//! a slice segment that would write into a CTB row already complete (only a
//! corrupt stream does that) is rejected, with any thread count. Here the
//! row may already be published, and other threads may be reading it.
